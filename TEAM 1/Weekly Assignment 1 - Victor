Question 1

A farmer lives on next to a river. 
One day, he crosses the river in a small boat and purchases a fox, a chicken, and a bag of seeds. 
When the farmer returns to his boat to cross the river again and go home, he realizes he has a problem.
The farmer can only take one item in his small boat at a time, otherwise he risks capsizing. 
He cannot leave the fox alone with the chicken, because the fox will eat the chicken. 
He cannot leave the chicken alone with the seeds, because the chicken with eat the seeds.
How does the farmer successfully get all three items across the river?


It can be done in 7 steps. The diagram ilustrates the order and the moves done:

(F(_) - Farmer carring something, Fx - Fox, Cn - Chicken and Bs - Bag of seeds)

0. F(Cn),Fx,Bs	- .
1. Fx,Bs		- F(Cn)
2. Fx,Bs,F()	- Cn
3. Bs			- F(Fx),Cn
4. Bs,F(Cn)	- Fx
5. Cn			- F(Bs),Fx
6. Cn,F()		- Fx,Bs
7. .			- F(Cn),Fx,Bs 


Question 2

You own a factory that labels and boxes apples and oranges for shipping. 
One day, the labeling machine malfunctions and incorrectly labels the containers of fruit.
Your coworker decides to play a game. 
He pulls up three crates and tells you that one of them has apples, one has oranges,and the last one has both apples and oranges in it. 
You can see that one is labeled "A" for apples, another "O" for oranges, and the third "A+O" for both apples and oranges. 
Your coworker reminds you that all three crates are incorrectly labeled.
You get to pick one crate, and your coworker will pull a fruit out of it and show you what it is. 
You get to do this only one time. 
How can you determine, without a doubt, which crate has apples, which one has oranges, and which one has both?

If it is guaranteed that all crates are incorrectly labeled, I must ask him to pick one fruit from the crate labeled (A+O),because it will define wich fruit this box has.

Crate1(Label:A)=> Has O or A+O
Crate2(Label:O)=> Has A or A+O
Crate3(Label:A+O)=> Has A or O

If the picked fruit is an A:

Crate1(Label:A)=> Has O 
Crate2(Label:O)=> Has A+O
Crate3(Label:A+O)=> Has A
 
If the picked fruit is an O:

Crate1(Label:A)=> Has A+O 
Crate2(Label:O)=> Has A
Crate3(Label:A+O)=> Has O
